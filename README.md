## Skills

#### Receptive 

At my previous position at NHS Mid Essex. I quickly went from being a new member of staff to being one of the most heavily relied on members of the team. In my first six months in my position I was chosen to be a 'champion' of a new software being implimented within the hospital. My role as a 'champion' required me to have extra training and then help staff in my office using the new software. I was chosen for my fast learning ability and my knowledge and intrest in technology and computers.
